<h1>The Best Movies Of All Time</h1>

<h2>Risa's Favourite Movies.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Return of the King</h3>

<p>The tale of Frodo Bagins comes to an end in this epic 3+ hour movie.<br/> I literally can watch it on repeat without any issue.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>Another epic movie. The human race needs a new home and space and time travel are the only solutions to this problem.<br/> 
A terrific cast and Hans Zimmer's scores made this movie magical!</p>

<h3>The Hobbit, The Desolation of Smaug</h3>

<p>Back to the world of elves and dwarves and magic and swords. By this time, you've come to realize that I am indeed a nerd.<br/>
Though this is the second of The Hobbit's three installments, it is my favourite because of the glorious dragon, Smaug.</p>
